# RInput

This is the client repository, [host](https://github.com/PonasKovas/rinput-host/) here.

Made with Godot, this mobile app lets you use your phone as a wireless controller for your PC (Linux only).

## Usage

Run the host application on your computer and then launch this app on your phone. You should see your
computer in the list, if both devices are on the same Wi-Fi. Enter your password, if set, and then click on your computer's name. If everything is done correctly you should be taken to the control screen, and a virtual controller should be added to your computer. You can start playing your games then :)

All contributions are very welcome.
